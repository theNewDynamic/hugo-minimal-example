_One of the great unexpected pleasures of redesigning our website came as we uploaded author photos. Many of them are incomparably wonderful, and in what I hope will be a semi-regular feature on the blog, we’ll point them out to you._

[Nicanor Parra](http://ndbooks.com/author/nicanor-parra). Theoretical physicist, cosmologist, anti-poet. Beloved by [Roberto Bolaño](http://ndbooks.com/author/roberto-bolano) as the antidote to Pablo Neruda, and the reason he’s on my mind lately (he’s mentioned repeatedly in [_Between Parentheses_](http://ndbooks.com/book/between-parentheses-essays-articles-and-speeches-1998-2003)).

![Parra_Nicanor1.jpg](https://www.ndbooks.com/images/authors/Parra_Nicanor1.jpg)I’m not exactly sure what I envisioned when I looked up his photograph, but I think it was something a bit more… revolutionary. Perhaps South American hipster, if such a thing exists. A mix of Ernesto "Che" Guevara’s guerrilla chic and [Ernesto Cardenal’](http://ndbooks.com/author/ernesto-cardenal)s socialist roguishness. Whatever it was that I’d expected, it wasn’t the photo you see to the right.

He’s downright debonair. The shirt/sweater/ascot combination suggests a man who is very thoughtful about his wardrobe, very precise, and yet the slightly long, windblown hair suggests a man of the world, a man who enjoys a drink and a cigar at three in the morning - like the inspiration for XX’s "Most Interesting Man in the World." And the eyes… whatever it is he’s looking at, he’s understanding it quickly and thoroughly — and also slightly dismissively. 

In retrospect, this is exactly how I should have pictured him: knowing, exacting, and daring.
