Everyday is Poetry Day at New Directions, but today is UNESCO’s official World Poetry Day. Whether your community is hosting readings, or a parade, or erecting a statue of the local poet laureate in your town square, today is the day to unabashedly celebrate the verse. Never written a poem? Perhaps today is the day you finally put pen to paper. And if you need encouragement, look no further than Chilean poet Nicanor Parra’s "Young Poets" from _Poems and Antipoems_ for sagely advise on composing poetry. And because this is _World _Poetry Day, we’ve included the Spanish original as well.
