![ND75Logo_wr.jpg](https://ndbooks.imgix.net/ND75Logo_wr.jpg)The night of Thursday, October 27 was rainy and chilly and the heat in the Great Hall at Cooper Union was basically nonexistant, but that didn’t stop several hundred people from showing up to see our all-star roster of New Directions fans read from and discuss their favorite books in honor of our 75th anniversary. Thanks again for coming, and we hope you snagged a door prize. 

Since we wanted to allow the readers to reveal their favorites as they took the stage, we didn’t include that information in the program. So in case you missed certain details, or want to investigate further, here is a list of what was read, and by whom:
