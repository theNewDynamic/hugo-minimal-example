Two years ago, Lou Reed participated in our 75th anniversary celebration by reading Delmore Schwartz’s short story "In Dreams Begin Responsibilities." Despite being the first reader in a long and festive evening, he read without pause for an astounding twewnty-three minutes. No one stirred. When it was over, Reed rapped the podium once with his knuckles, having completed an extraordinary tribute.

But he wasn’t done—a few months later, Reed offered New Directions a poetic preface to accompany our new edition of _In Dreams Begin Responsibilites_. Before NYC and the Velvet Undergound, while still studying at Syracuse, Reed had been Schwartz’s student. As he said in a lyric some years later, Scwhartz was "the first great man [he] ever met."

> O Delmore how I miss you. You inspired me to write. You were the greatest man I ever met. You could capture the deepest emotions in the simplest language. Your titles were more than enough to raise the muse of fire on my neck. You were a genius. Doomed. ... I’d given him a short story. He gave me a B. I was so hurt and ashamed. Why haunt talentless me.

Despite the less than stellar grade, Schwartz took Reed under his wing and into his confidence, inviting him to various literary events or bars where, over rounds of sctoch, they would lambast each song and lyric pouring out of the juke box. When Reed graduated from Syracuse, one great talent was about to soar while another retreated. During the spring of ’66, when the Velvet Underground was recording its debut album, Schwartz had isolated himself in a hotel room and cut off almost all human contact. He died later that summer. Reed dedicated "European Son," the last track on _The Velvet Underground and Nico, _to his former mentor.

Years later, The Velvet Underground already a legend, with the grand _Transformer_ and the more experimental _Metal Machine Music_ under his belt, Reed would come back to a more stripped-down style in _Blue Mask_ (1982), which included another touching tribute to Schwartz, "My House." 

> Delmore, I missed all your funny ways
> I missed your jokes and the brilliant things you said
> My Dedalus to your Bloom, was such a perfect wit
> and to find you in my house makes things perfect
> 
> I really got a lucky life
> my writing, my motorcycle and my wife
> And to top it all off a spirit of pure poetry
> is living in this stone and wood house with me

Admiration is a chain. Those we admire, in turn, admire others, and it is the longing to be accepted and praised by those we hold in the highest esteem that drives us to achieve for ourselves. Lou Reed’s lasting influence and admiration can be summed up in Brian Eno’s famous observation that "although The Velvet Underground’s debut may have sold only a few thousand copies, everyone who bought it started a band."  One wonders, however, if Lou Reed, for all his accomplishments and accolades, for the gifts of melody and lyric to which we tap a foot or sing along, had always wanted perhaps to show his old professor this his instict had been right: that he would have made Delmore proud. We’d like to think this as we mourn the loss of Lou Reed.
