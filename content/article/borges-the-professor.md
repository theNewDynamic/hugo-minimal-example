Finally available in English, thanks to a wonderful translation by [Katherine Silver](http://ndbooks.com/author/katherine-silver), _[Professor Borges](http://ndbooks.com/book/professor-borges)_ is a transcribed series of lectures that the Argentine author gave at the University of Buenos Aires in 1966. The subject? The history of English Literature. That alone should be enough to intrigue you, but it’s also worth noting a few details. For starters, Borges was already blind when he gave the twenty-five lectures, and so everything he said, including all of the passages he quotes, was done from memory. Second, the lectures only exist in written form because a few students made audio recordings, which they then used to make the transcriptions, which were then shared with students who weren’t in the class. (The audio files, unfortunately, are lost to the ether of history; the studentes re-used the tapes in different classes.) The students were unbelievably faithful in their transcriptions, including every word he said. At one point, while reciting a poem by William Blake, he makes a mistake and starts over, and all of this is recorded for the reader’s benefit. The result is simply charming. 

_The New York Review of Books_ [blog](http://www.nybooks.com/blogs/nyrblog/) has an excerpt, a portion of Borges’s lecture on Boswell and Johnson and the creation of Boswell’s famous biography. [Have a look](http://www.nybooks.com/blogs/nyrblog/).

And while we’re discussing Borges the lecturer, courtesy of [Open Culture](http://www.openculture.com/2012/05/jorge_luis_borges_1967-8_norton_lectures_on_poetry_and_everything_else_literary.html) are audio recordings of Borges’ Norton lectures, delivered at Harvard University in 1697-8. They, too, are remarkable. Enjoy.
