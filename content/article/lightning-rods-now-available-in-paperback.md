To read through (the long, amazing list of) reviews and interviews with DeWitt, visit the [book’s page](http://ndbooks.com/book/lightning-rods) — but not before you read the short excerpt below, a glimpse of DeWitt’s subtle mastery of the language of salesmanship as she skewers American ideals and sexual mores.

> Once he had a foot in the door he explained, “It’s not for me to make moral judgments. I’m a businessman. I deal with people as they are, not as they ought to be.”
> 
> “Speaking as a businessman,” he went on, “I know that it is often the most valuable individuals in a company who present the greatest vulnerability to sexual harassment related issues. We know that a high level of testosterone is inseparable from the drive that produces results. Speaking of people as they are rather than as they should be I know that a high-testosterone-level individual has a high likelihood of being sexually aggressive; if the individual is working twenty-hour days as a driven results-orientated individual often does, that sexual aggression will find an outlet in the office.”
> 
> “Well.”
> 
> “You invest in training. A man is bringing in $100 million of business. You leave him open to the danger of momentarily forgetting himself with a little $25,000-a-year secretary?”
> 
> “Well . . .”
> 
> “A properly run organization protects its employees.”
> 
> “Sure, but . . .”
> 
> “I have strong views on sexual harassment. I believe that those in a place of work who do not welcome sexual advances should not be subjected to them. I also believe that a man who is producing results in today’s competitive market place has a right to be protected from potential undesirable side effects of the physical constitution which enables him to make a valued contribution to the company.”
> 
> At this stage he might be asked, “Are you suggesting we hire prostitutes?!” Or “Surely you are not suggesting…!”
> 
> “Certainly not,” he would protest, “prostitution is degrading to all concerned, an atmosphere of mutual respect is indispensable in the modern office.”
> 
> “I don’t understand,” he would be told.
> 
> The concept was so revolutionary at the time that prostitution was the only thing people could think of. That was how original he was. He had to explain the whole thing from the word Go. He would explain the concept of the lightning rod in the face of skepticism.
> 
> He would explain the importance of confidentiality.
> 
> He would say: “The last thing we want to do is ghettoize a certain class of women. What we are doing is introducing highly qualified professionals to the workplace. These are women who on their credentials could walk straight into an opening of a more conventional nature, women with goals to pursue who are willing to make a real contribution to the company.”
> 
> He would say: “The average man things of sex every five seconds.”
> 
> “The average employee,” Joe would add, “spends two minutes in the course of a year reading the sexual harassment policy. If that. This is not, in my opinion, the level of protection which is appropriate to a high-testosterone performance-orientated individual.”
> 
> He would sometimes add that access to the lightning rods could be restricted to high performers, acting as an incentive to less driven individuals.
