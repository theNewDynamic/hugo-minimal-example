Another week in April, another chance to celebrate National Poetry Month, and another excerpt from one of our new [Poetry Pamphlets](http://ndbooks.com/book/poetry-pamphlets). This one is from Canadian poet Sylvia Legris and her first US publication, a collection entitled [_Pneumatic Antiphonal_](http://ndbooks.com/book/pneumatic-antiphonal). When I asked editor Jeffrey Yang to give a sense of the book, he said, "What is the poetry of birdsong? Its physiology, spectography, and lore? Read Sylvia Legris’ _Pneumatic Antiphonal_ and you’ll be tweeting the week away." 

> **Lore: 5 (agonist)**
> 
> The wandering, halting warble of the Evening Grosbeak. The male of the species with a distinctive yellow flash extending from the base of its beak over the eyebrow towards the back of its head.
> 
> A reed-like fluticosone singing. Irregular summer laggard. The long-term corticosteroid song less clearly articulated.

> Bronchodilators increase the bird-flow. Beta-agonists arouse an adrenalin of upperwings; primaries and outer tail feathers sputter the nest. The horizontal fissure issues a shrill clee-ip clee-ip.
