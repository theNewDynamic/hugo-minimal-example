_Due to popular demand, and as a concession to common sense, we’ve decided to put poems here on our website — one poet per week._

![Thomas_Dylan1.jpg](https://www.ndbooks.com/images/authors/Thomas_Dylan1.jpg)Now that Valentine’s Day has passed, and now that it’s turned cold and rainy, at least here in New York, why not hunker down with some poetry by Dylan Thomas. 

Literary haunts, real and fictional, are everywhere in New York. I think of DeLillo when I pass Great Jones Street; Millay when I pass what used to be St. Vincent’s hospital; Selby whenever I’m in Red Hook or near the Navy Yard; Pynchon whenever fleet week comes around; and so on and so forth. But the closest "landmark" is the White Horse Tavern, which sits only a few blocks from our offices at the intersection of the West Village, Chelsea, and the Meatpacking District. And each and every time I pass it I try to envision Dylan Thomas sitting at the bar, sipping a drink, alone, his eyes narrowing as the night wears on. I’m perhaps guilty or romanticizing the notion of the tortured, drunken writer, but the legend is simply too powerful. I also, every time, think of a verse by Tom Waits, in the song "Lucinda": "I was standing outside the White Hourse, but I was afraid to go in." Is he referring to the White Horse on Hudson Street in New York, or some other bar, somewhere else, somewhere imaginary. Does it matter, really?  

The entry in _[The Way It Wasn’t](http://ndbooks.com/book/the-way-it-wasnt) —_ a collection of memories and memorabilia — on Dylan Thomas includes a heartbreaking memory from New Directions founder James Laughlin. He explains that when Thomas died, Laughlin and John Brinnin, Thomas’ American tour agent, flipped a coin to determine who would have to go to Bellevue to identify the body. Laughlin lost, identified the body, and then answered questions for a form. They wanted to know his profession, and so Laughlin told the young woman ("She was about four feet high, and I don’t think she had even finished high school yet.") that he was a poet, to which she replied, "What’s that?" 

"He wrote poetry," he replied. The form ended up saying "Dylan Thomas. He wrote poetry."

So, yes. I associate the White Horse Tavern with Dylan Thomas, with alcohol as the overarching theme. It’s how he’s remembered, sadly, but we bother to remember it because we still love his poetry. And it endures; gets me every time I read it. Take the two poems below, for example. The first is as spare as he gets, and yet the imagery of the poet at work, and of life going on around him while he works, is remarkably poignant without being even remotely saccharine or self-indulgent. And the second, which is about half of an unfinished poem given the title "Elegy" (printed in _The Collected Poems_), evokes those quintessentially Thomas themes: unflagging humanism, strength in the face of loss and defeat, confusion at the inability to live forever.

> **"In My Craft or Sullen Art"**
> 
> In my craft or sullen art
> Exercised in the still night
> When only the moon rages
> And the lovers lie abed
> With all their griefs in their arms,
> I labour by singing light
> Not for ambition or bread
> Or the strut and trade of charms
> On the ivory stages
> But for the common wages
> Of their most secret heart.
> 
> Not for the proud man apart
> From the raging moon I write
> On these spindrift pages
> Nor for the towering dead
> With their nightingales and psalms
> But for the lovers, their arms
> Round the griefs of the ages,
> Who pay no praise or wages
> Nor heed my craft or art.

> **From "Elegy," an unfinished poem**
> 
> Being innocent, he dreaded that he died
> Hating his God, but what he was was plain:
> An old kind man brave in his burning pride.
> 
> The sticks of the house were his; his books he owned.
> Even as a baby he had never cried;
> Nor did he now, save to his secret wound.
> 
> Out of his eyes I saw the last light glide.
> Here among the light of the lording sky
> An old blind man is with me where I go
> 
> Walking in the meadows of his son’s eye
> On whom a world of ills came down like snow.
> He cried as he died, fearing at last the spheres’
> 
> Last sound, the world going out without a breath:
> Too proud to cry, too frail to check the tears,
> And caught between two nights, blindness and death.
> 
> O deepest wound of all that he should die
> On that darkest day. Oh, he could hide
> The tears out of his eyes, too proud to cry.
> 
> Until I die he will not leave my side.
