Lawrence Ferlinghetti is a legendary figure in American literature. He opened City Lights Bookstore in San Francisco. He published Ginsberg’s "Howl". And his collection _A Coney Island of the Mind_ has sold millions — yes, millions — of copies around the world. 

Now he’s the subject of a documentary film, _Ferlinghetti: A Rebirth of Wonder_. In its [review](http://movies.nytimes.com/2013/02/08/movies/ferlinghetti-a-rebirth-of-wonder-by-christopher-felver.html?_r=0), _The New York Times_ says, "This biography is often effusive in its praise, but some lives and legacies were meant for a tribute." And we agree. Go see it. Soon.
