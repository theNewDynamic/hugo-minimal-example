Not to jump onto the bandwagon of hype that is surrounding_ The Great Gatsby_ movie, but here’s a bit of _Gatsby_ trivia: New Directions published an edition of F. Scott Fitzgerald’s magnum opus  in 1945.

From what I understand, Scribner’s had let the book lapse out-of-print, allowing New Directions to lease the rights. James Laughlin—a longtime Fitzgerald fan (before it was hip to be one)—acquired _The Great Gatsby_ for its New Classics series—the jacket art (above) was designed by Alvin Lustig. The book went through only one printing before Scribner’s terminated the leasing contract for a more lucrative deal with [Armed Services Editions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Services_Editions). Today, an ND edition of _The_ _Great Gatsby _goes for a few hundred dollars—a current [ebay auction](http://www.ebay.com/itm/F-SCOTT-FITZGERALD-The-Great-Gatsby-NEW-DIRECTIONS-BOOKS-w-Alvin-Lustig-DJ-/190592998009) has a copy up for grabs starting at $548.00. 

For a much more affordable way to own the ND _Gatsby_, it will be included in our forthcoming collection of [Alvin Lustig postards](http://ndbooks.com/book/alvin-lustig-for-new-directions)—50 of his best ND designs in a box.
