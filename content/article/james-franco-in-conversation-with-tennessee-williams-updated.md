We can keep quiet on this odd bit of theater news no longer. 

Multi-talented actor James Franco will make a one-time appearance in a commissioned play entitled _Three Artists in Search of Tennessee Williams_. Being staged this Sunday, November 13 at noon, the play is part of the [Performa 11](http://11.performa-arts.org/event/laurel-nakadate-and-james-franco) biennial festival that’s currently underway in New York. Act II features a video of Franco playing the Gentlemen Caller from _[The Glass Menagerie](http://ndbooks.com/book/the-glass-menagerie)_, while a series of actresses audition for the role of Laura via karaoke. And in Act III  male actors will audition for the role of Tom, with Franco and co-star Laurel Nakadate playing directors, producers, and possibly a certain writer. 

So far so good; Franco has proven to be quite good at channelling the icons of yesteryear, and we are all in favor of meta-plays about Tennessee. But the head-scratching portion of the play is actually in Act I, when Franco and Nakadate "will lead a séance with an invited group of special guests to communicate with Tennessee Williams through a Ouija board and receive instructions from the author’s spirit." 

I admit I’m a little curious about the invited group of special guests (John Waters?), but the important part of that sentence is the fact that they’ll **_communicate with Tennessee Williams through a Ouija board!_ **Personal beliefs (or lack thereof) in the supernatural aside, I do hope this works out. Godspeed, Mr. Franco. 

Tickets are sold out, of course, though you can get on a [waiting list](http://nakadatefranco.eventbrite.com/). Luckily the co-sponsor, [Paddle8](http://www.paddle8.com/), will have video of the performance on its website later that same night. I fully expect the spectre of Tennessee to be in his Sunday best. 

**[Update]**

_The L Magazine_ was at the performance and has a write-up [here](http://www.thelmagazine.com/TheMeasure/archives/2011/11/14/performa-11-james-franco-and-laurel-nakadate-channel-tennessee-williams). The audience, it seems, tended towards "cynical, snickering disbelief."
