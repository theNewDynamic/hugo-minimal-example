Today is the official publication day of our new, expanded, anniversary edition of Raymond Queneau’s groundbreaking experimental "novel" [_Exercises in Style_](http://ndbooks.com/book/exercises-in-style-anniversary). 

This new edition has a few special features. First, the beautiful new (old) cover. Second, pieces written by Queneau that, for whatever reason, were left out of the original edition but have now been translated (by Chris Clarke) and added at the end. And third, homage pieces written by some contemporary writers, all of them proven stylists in their own right. A lot of these new exercises, by Queneau and his progeny, have been excerpted, and links are below. Translator Chris Clarke has also been discussing Queneau with OuLiPo member Daniel Levin Becker (author of [_Many Subtle Channels_](http://www.amazon.com/Many-Subtle-Channels-Potential-Literature/dp/0674065778/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1359490270&sr=1-1&keywords=many+subtle+channels)) here on our website. Of course there are already some reviews and appreciations of the book, too, and we’ll update this post as more arise.

There’s also an event in the works. Stay tuned.
