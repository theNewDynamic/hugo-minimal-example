This Friday, poet Susan Howe will again be teaming up with musician David Grubbs for a performance at Brooklyn’s [ISSUE Project Room](http://issueprojectroom.org/drupal/event/marina-rosenfeld-david-grubbs-susan-howe) as part of its "Ten Years Alive" series. It’s a poetry reading unlike any other — using various software, Grubbs manipulates and weaves wisps of sound and voice as Susan reads from her work, resulting in an astonishing sonic conversation. 

Howe and Grubbs are longtime collaborators, having worked most recently on the piece _[Frolic Architecture](http://www.grenfellpress.com/books/susan-howe-james-welling-frolic-architecture.html) _(featured in Howe’s _[That This](http://ndbooks.com/book/that-this)_). For this performance, they will be performing from Howe’s new chapbook of collage poems, _Tom Tit Tot_,  which was shown at the Yale Union in Portland, Oregon. You can see pictures from the exhibition [here](http://share.shutterfly.com/share/received/welcome.sfly?fid=4c33e25f99a83f80&sid=wAauGrVo2bNmbVhgw).
