On a recent Sunday, Unrue, who changed her plane ticket to a train ticket so she could make it to New York from snow-locked Boston, arrived at McNally Jackson to read from her new work and to talk with _Adult_ magazine founder Sarah Nicole Prickett.

The great poet Rosmarie Waldrop says of Unrue's first book with New Directions, "Rather than leading us out of the maze, the narrative thread has itself become a labyrinthine tangle. We don't get far before we're stopped and pushed in a different direction, space, situation. From reality into dream, from the erotic to mock mystery, horror, humor, from architectural precision to the dark wood of fairy tales. And, amazingly, we would like to stay forever in this tangle made delightful by the very rhythm of cut-offs and repetitions—and the sheer power of Unrue's language."

Many pages of _Love Hotel_ carry only one sentence ("A canary in a cage."), a fragment ("I stuck the key into the"), or simply a sound ("Uh huh"). Unrue's sentences often break hard like lines of poetry, even though the writer she returns to again and again (she revealed) is master of the unbroken sentence, Henry James.

During the Q & A, one audience member asked about a three-way sex scene that occurs midway through the book, to which Prickett exclaimed: "Wait! _That_ was the sex scene?" _Love Hotel_ holds secrets. Members of the audience asked questions that revealed they were curious to know the unwritten rules guiding Unrue's storytelling but were also, like Waldrop, comfortable enough being pushed and pulled in the "labrynthine tangle." In her final word to the audience, firm but unsettling, Unrue told us that _Love Hotel_ is actually "a very simple story."

From _Love Hotel_:

When a person who has not known suffering walks into a certain kind
of room she will be saddened shocked confused by what she feels
by what she knows
has happened there.
