Beginning on April 5 — when an exhibition entitled _[Back Tomorrow: Federico García Lorca / Poet in New York](http://www.nypl.org/events/exhibitions/back-tomorrow-federico-garc%C3%ADa-lorca-poet-new-york) _opens at the New York Public Library — our fair city is hosting a celebration of the famed poet, who spent nine months here in 1929, time that changed his perceptions of poetry, the role of the artist in society, and of the world in general. 

The centerpiece of the exhibition is the manuscript for Lorca’s _Poet in New York_, which has a fascinating, if heartbreaking, story of its own:

> Lorca came to New York to study English but devoted himself instead to writing Poet in New York, a howl of protest against racial bigotry, mindless consumption, and the adoration of technology. “What we call civilization, he called slime and wire,” the critic V. S. Pritchett once wrote. But Lorca’s book reaches beyond New York — “this maddening, boisterous Babel”—into the depths of the psyche, in a search for wholeness and redemption.
> 
> In 1936, the poet left the manuscript of **Poet in New York** on the desk of his Madrid publisher with a note saying he would be “back tomorrow,” probably to discuss final details. He never returned. Weeks later, at the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, he was brutally murdered by fascist elements in Granada, his body thrown into an unmarked mass grave. The book was published posthumously in 1940, but the manuscript mysteriously disappeared, lost to scholars for decades. The Fundación Federico García Lorca in Madrid and The New York Public Library exhibit it now for the first time, together with drawings, photographs, letters, and mementos — traces of a **Poet in New York** . . . and of New York in a poet.

Over on the "Lorca in NY" [website](http://lorcanyc.com/), you’ll find a [program](http://lorcanyc.com/program) providing details on over twenty events, such as:

• A "musical, theatrical, spoken word celebration and interpretation of Lorca’s writings and favorite Flamenco, Sevillana and Tango songs performed by some of American’s leading spoken word artists" at the Bowery Poetry Club on April 7.

• A tribute concert by Patti Smith and friends at the Bowery Ballroom on June 5.

• A Lorca walking tour in the Columbia University area, also on June 5.
