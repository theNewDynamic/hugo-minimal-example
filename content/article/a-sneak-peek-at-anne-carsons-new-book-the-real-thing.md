Presented with a minimum of commentary, Anne Carson’s _[Antigonick](http://ndbooks.com/book/antigonick)_.

We posted a [preview](http://ndbooks.com/blog/article/a-sneak-peek-at-anne-carsons-new-book) back in January, but now have in our possession the only pair of finished copies in the Western Hemisphere (the remainder are being shipped, via freighter, from the speciality printer in China and will arrive in early May).

An illustration on translucent velum, with the text visible beneath.
I’ve been fond of the term "ghosting through."
