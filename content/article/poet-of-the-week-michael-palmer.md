_Due to popular demand, and as a concession to common sense, we’ve decided to put poems here on our website — one poet per week._

A few months back we shared the wonderful news that poet [Michael Palmer](http://ndbooks.com/author/michael-palmer) has been honored by the American Academy of Arts and Letters with an award for general excellence in literature. The ceremony itself is happening right now in New York, and so we’re taking the opportunity to say "Congratulations" again.

The second and last section of Michael Palmer’s new poetry collection, [_Thread_](http://ndbooks.com/book/thread), is a cycle of eighteen dream-like lyrics also titled “Thread,” and subtitled “(Stanzas in Counterlight).” Here are three poems from this section, a section of shadows and echoes, of wings and the slaughter of wings, where figures of the dead are spoken to and listened to.

_          Nighthawk and sun-bird
          beauty of the world      beauty of the world_

          How can one write      _beauty of the world?_

          Fumbled for each other in the dark
          familiar, unfamiliar, the touch

          of watery air

          walls, weight      of watery air

          cards scattered across a table,
          game of chance they had played

                        *  *  *

          _Circling lost_
          through the narrow streets
          of the Old City
          among the shuttered shops
          they hear nothing
          but the howling of dogs drifting down
          from the hills above
          from the dark
          of the parched hills
          _threnos_—thread—lament
          barely vibrating web
          of sleep’s winding streets

                        *  *  *

          _Nighthawk and sun-bird_
          Who will tell of it

          Shore’s eyelid, earth’s rim
          light from extinguished stars

          bathing us 
          in time’s wake

          time’s long
          stream of slaughter

          and song
          Some love

          the one more
          some the other
