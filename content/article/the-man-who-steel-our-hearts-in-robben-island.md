_Living in this solitude
surrounded by its waters
whales conquistadores voyagers_

_Quarrying each day and every day
into the hard blind limestone blisters
of yr memory  .  re-_

_membering everything until it seem
like nothing.  whirling whispers 
the art of how forgiveness is revenge_

_The engines of yr heart
work through the past & present
far into dreaming night_

_And you will walk one day Mandela
at last w/Zanyiwe Madikizela at yr side
yr hammer fist of stone upright in_

_triumph & salute into the blazing future
Even tho .   in this iconic monument
there is no absolute_
