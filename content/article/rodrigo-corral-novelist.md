We aren’t typically keen on bringing your attention to books published by _other_ publishers, but we do make certain exceptions, and this certainly qualifies as one.

If you ever turned over a New Directions book — after admiring the cover — to look for the design credit, then you know who [Rodrigo Corral](http://ndbooks.com/designer/rodrigo-corral) is. As our creative director at-large, he’s been responsible for over two dozen beautiful covers over the past five years, including the new edition of _[Berlin Stories](http://ndbooks.com/book/berlin-stories)_, last year’s [_Between Parentheses_](http://ndbooks.com/book/between-parentheses-essays-articles-and-speeches-1998-2003), and the entire [Pearl](http://ndbooks.com/books/series/16/Pearls/) series, just to name a few. 

![RC.jpeg](https://ndbooks.imgix.net/RC.jpeg)But Rodrigo is also a writer, and — along with co-author Jessica Anthony — has just published his first novel, [_Chopsticks_](http://www.powells.com/biblio/62-9781595144355-0). At the center of the novel is a young piano prodigy named Glory, who mysteriously goes missing one day. Through a variety of new and old forms of media (newspaper clippings, instant messages, videos, etc.) that are embedded in the novel (and brought to life in the iPad and iPhone versions) the reader develops a sense of what happened to Glory in the eighteen months prior to her disappearance from a mental hospital, where she’d been committed for obsessively playing “chopsticks.”

We don’t want to give too much away; you’ll have to experience it for yourself.

On behalf of everyone at New Directions, we’d like to say one simple thing to Rodrigo: Congratulations!
