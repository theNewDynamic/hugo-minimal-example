Last night I put on my favorite suit and made the trek to midtown to the Permanent Cuban Mission to the United Nations — housed in a spacious, if slightly rundown, building on Lexington Avenue a few blocks from the U.N. headquarters — to celebrate the publication of the new book _[Who Killed Che?](http://www.orbooks.com/our-books/who-killed-che/)_ Mojitos were served, pictures were taken, and Ricardo Alarcón, President of the Cuban National Assembly, spoke to the large crowd via telephone. During one of many conversations about Occupy Wall Street, someone mentioned Che’s famous U.N. speech, which made me think of this picture:

Simone de Beauvoir, Jean-Paul Sartre, and Che Guevara. I don’t believe that any formal account of what they discussed exists, but then again it might not matter. The looks on their faces are fascinating enough; the details are endlessly intriguing.
