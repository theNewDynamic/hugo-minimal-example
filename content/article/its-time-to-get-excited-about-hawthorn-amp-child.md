After almost a year of anticipation, we’re finally mere days away from the official publication date of Keith Ridgway’s [_Hawthorn & Child_](http://ndbooks.com/book/hawthorn-child), a novel so mind-bendingly brilliant that it very nearly defies description. But one must try, right? How about this, borrowed from Granta Books, who published it in the UK:

> Hawthorn and Child are mid-ranking detectives tasked with finding significance in the scattered facts. They appear and disappear in the fragments of this book along with a ghost car, a crime boss, a pick-pocket, a dead racing driver and a pack of wolves. The mysteries are everywhere, but the biggest of all is our mysterious compulsion to solve them. In **Hawthorn & Child**, the only certainty is that we’ve all misunderstood everything.

In case you missed our recent newsletter (sign up on our homepage beneath where it says CONNECT), Ridgway will be making two appearance in New York. First, during the [Brooklyn Book Festival](http://www.brooklynbookfestival.org/BBF/FestivalEvents) (where we’ll have copies of the book at our table, #77) on Sunday, September 22, he’ll be read and discuss his work as part of a panel called "Noir-ish," along with  Adam Mansbach and Nelly Reifler, taking place outside on the North Stage at 4pm. And on the evening (publication day!) of Monday, September 23, he’ll be at [McNally Jackson Books](http://www.mcnallyjackson.com/event/new-directions-presents-keith-ridgway) in SoHo for a reading, discussion, and signing at 7pm.

Finally we get to the point of this post: sharing a short excerpt. Just the first few paragraphs, but hopefully enough to whet your appetite. By the way, I read this book about a year ago and completely failed to notice the bewildering chapter title here at the very beginning of the book: 1934. There’s no mention of the number or year anywhere else. 

> He dreamed he was sleeping, and Child was driving. Driving but not moving. He was sleeping on the passenger seat and Child wrestled with the wheel, but the car was still. It was the city that was moving. It was dark. The city rushed past them like words on a screen, and he would have read them but they went too fast. He was filled with sorrow. It trickled through him and filled his eyes. He wept and he didn’t know why, and he was embarrassed by it but he could not stop. He cried so much that his face disappeared. He dreamed that the siren was on, and it was so loud that it woke him.

> He awoke. Child was driving. The city was still and they rushed through it. That was the difference. A finger across a page, taking corners not turning them, hopping little hills, drawing zigzag ciphers on the wide, empty intersections.
> 
> His shoulder was pressed into the door and pulled away from it and he touched his seat belt. He had an erection. He wiped at his eyes. Child was smiling at the road. He wouldn’t drive like this at any other time of the day. He wouldn’t be able to.
