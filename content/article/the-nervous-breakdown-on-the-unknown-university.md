Critic [J.P. Smith](http://www.thenervousbreakdown.com/jpsmith/2013/07/a-review-of-the-unknown-university-by-roberto-bolano/) says that the [collection](http://ndbooks.com/book/the-unknown-university)  "gives us the world as he knows it — the flash of a blade, the cruel betrayal of a woman, the underbelly (figurative and literal) of the public baths."
