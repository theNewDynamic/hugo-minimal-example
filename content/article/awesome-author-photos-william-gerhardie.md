_One of the great unexpected pleasures of redesigning our website came as we uploaded author photos. Many of them are incomparably wonderful, and in what I hope will be a semi-regular feature on the blog, we’ll point them out to you. _

![Gerhardie_William.jpg](https://www.ndbooks.com/images/authors/Gerhardie_William.jpg)Today we present William Gerhardie, an Anglo-Russian writer who was championed by such lauded figures as Evelyn Waugh and H.G. Wells, but who seems to have disappeared almost entirely from the culture radar, at least on our side of the pond. Well, to that I say, have a look at the picture on the right. 

As far as I’m concerned, any writer who can pull off that hat-and-jacket combo (and in my opinion, he does) deserves to have his name burrowed into any decently well-read individual’s mind. 

Originally written in 1922, while Gerhardie was still in college, New Directions published a new edition of his first novel, [_Futility_](http://ndbooks.com/book/futility), in 1991. It draws heavily on his own experiences in pre-Revolutionary Russia and seems — I confess I haven’t read it yet myself — to have been written in a comic-nihilist tone, which was of course echoed later in the century by everyone from Samuel Beckett to Joseph Heller.
